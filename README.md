<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To run the api backend run:
```sh
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0
```

Now the api should be accessible from `http://local_ip:8000`

To access an api playground go to `http://local_ip:8000/docs`

_For more information, please refer to the [Documentation](https://openscan-org.github.io/OpenScan-Doc/)_



**Add ramdisk to improve capturing speed (if space available)**


```ini
#/etc/fstab

proc            /proc           proc    defaults          0       0
PARTUUID=e46ea0e2-01  /boot           vfat    defaults          0       2
PARTUUID=e46ea0e2-02  /               ext4    defaults,noatime  0       1
# a swapfile is not a swap partition, no line here
#   use  dphys-swapfile swap[on|off]  for that


tmpfs /mnt/ramdisk tmpfs nodev,nosuid,size=256M 0 0

```
Then start the server

```sh
TMPDIR=/mnt/ramdisk uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0
```
